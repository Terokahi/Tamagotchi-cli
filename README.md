# What can it do?
for now, nothing really, besides lose stats and die (and dance! (but only on CLI))

# What's next?
multiple things, in order of priority:
- actually being able to save and load a game (done)
- rework saving to also save the inventory
- being able to access the shop and buying stuff (done)
- Implementing Tkinter so you can choose if you want a gui or cli (partially done)
- bought Items should have the desired effect on the Tamagotchi (done)
- Implement Threading for os independency (done)
- think of small games to make money (send the Tamagotchi working?)

# What will it be able to do?
I don't really know, there will more then likely be shop,
with Items that modify the tamagotchi (Make it move faster, lose more/less stats and maybe more.)

# What do I need to run it?
besides a working python installation nothing,
every module used is included in standard python3.
Every module that isn't is handmade.
